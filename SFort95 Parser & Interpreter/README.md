# SFort95 Parser & Interpreter
This was a **C++** project in which I made use of coding concepts such as **tokens** and **recursive descent** in order to create a functional parser and interpreter for a simple, Fortran95-like programming language.

SFort95.exe is the output file resulting from the compilation of all the other .cpp and .h files present in the project. Test files and the text files indicating the desired output are provided so that you may download the program and test it out for yourself in a terminal if you wish.

To run the program, download the exe file and run it in the terminal along with the file path to the file you wish the program to parse and interpret (e.g SFort95.exe "Test Cases\test1"). The output will be in the console.
