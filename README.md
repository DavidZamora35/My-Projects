# My Projects

This is a repository to hold any of my projects that aren't large enough to warrant having their own standalone repository. Currently this repository contains...
* Airplane Passenger Satisfaction Analysis - HTML file containing python code for machine learning and its results
* Yahoo Stocks Web Scraper - A python file making use of BeautifulSoup and MongoDB to scrape and store stock information, and a php file to host the scraped stock information.
