# My Projects

This is a repository to hold any of my projects that aren't large enough to warrant having their own standalone repository. Currently this repository contains...
* **Airplane Passenger Satisfaction Analysis** - **HTML** file containing **Python** code for machine learning and its results
* **SFort95 Parser & Interpreter** - A **C++** project containing several **C++** files for the purpose of compiling a simple Fortran95-like parser and interpreter
* **Yahoo Stocks Web Scraper** - A **Python** file making use of **BeautifulSoup** and **MongoDB** to scrape and store stock information, and a **PHP** file to host the scraped stock information
