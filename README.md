# My Projects

### This is a repository to hold any of my **software** projects that aren't large enough to warrant having their own standalone repository. Currently this repository contains...
* **Airplane Passenger Satisfaction Analysis** - **HTML** file containing **Python** code for machine learning and its results.
* **SFort95 Parser & Interpreter** - A **C++** project containing several **C++** files for the purpose of compiling a simple Fortran95-like parser and interpreter.
* **Yahoo Stocks Web Scraper** - A **Python** file making use of **BeautifulSoup** and **MongoDB** to scrape and store stock information, and a **PHP** file to host the scraped stock information.

### I also have other **web development** projects in their own standalone repositories...
* [**Film Rental Website**](https://github.com/DavidZamora35/FilmRentalWebsite) - Website for simulating a film rental store using the **Next.js** framework. **React**, **Typescript** and **Tailwind CSS** for the **frontend**, **Prisma** and **MySQL Workbench** for the **backend**.
* [**Betterhealth**](https://github.com/betterhealth490/betterhealth/tree/main) - Website to help therapists and those seeking therapy to reach each other. Uses the same framework and **frontend** setup as the Film Rental Website above, but uses **Drizzle** for the **backend**.

### Android **app development** projects in this repository...
* [**Android Projects**](https://github.com/DavidZamora35/Android-Projects) - Repository containing many Android projects created for the Codepath Android Development course.

### As well as another **game development** project on itch.io...
* [**Incretumna**](https://itch.io/jam/igda-october-game-jam-2023/rate/2306477) - A short 2D platformer created in just 2 days for IGDA's 2023 October Game Jam. The game was created in the **Godot** engine, and all assets used were created by me.
